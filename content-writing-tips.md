# Content Writing Tips for Small Business Websites

A guide from **Cider House Media**, written to help small business owners create content that sounds natural, connects with real people, and performs well online.  

Whether you’re writing your own website copy or hiring someone else to do it, these principles will help you recognize what good web writing looks and feels like.

## 1. Know Who You’re Talking To

Before you write a word, picture your ideal customer.  
What are they trying to accomplish when they land on your site? What problem do they need solved right now?  

If you’re working with a copywriter or agency, they should start by asking questions about your audience, not just your services.  
Strong content begins with empathy — understanding the customer’s situation and speaking to it directly.

## 2. Write Like a Person, Not a Company

People trust people.  
Your web content should sound like a conversation, not a corporate memo.  

Use contractions (“you’ll,” “we’re”), skip the buzzwords, and speak plainly.  
If you read your copy out loud and it sounds like something you’d actually say to a customer, you’re on the right track.  

When hiring a writer, look for samples that feel approachable, not stiff or over-polished.

## 3. Keep It Focused and Scannable

Most readers skim, not read.  
Use short paragraphs, clear subheadings, and bullet points so key information stands out.  

Avoid burying your main points in long blocks of text.  
Each page should have one main idea — a single purpose — whether it’s describing your services, sharing your story, or inviting people to reach out.

---

## 4. Lead with Benefits, Not Features

It’s easy to fall into listing what you do:  
> “We build WordPress websites, manage SEO, and design logos.”  

That’s fine — but it’s not what your visitor cares about most. They care about results:  
> “We help small businesses look credible online, attract more local customers, and grow through smart design and SEO.”  

If you’re working with a writer, they should always translate features into benefits — the *why it matters* part.

---

## 5. Optimize Without Over-Optimizing

Search engines still matter, but stuffing keywords never works.  
Instead, weave key phrases naturally into your writing — especially in your headings, the first paragraph, and page titles.  

If your business serves a region, use your **city or area name** naturally in your copy (e.g., “Web Design in Easthampton, Massachusetts”).  

Good content should *read first, rank second.*

## 6. Tell Your Story — But Keep It About Them

Your origin story matters — people love to know who’s behind a small business.  
But the goal isn’t to talk about yourself endlessly; it’s to show how your experience helps your customers.  

When you share your story, tie it back to their needs.  
For example:  
> “We started Cider House Media to help local businesses tell their stories online — because every town has makers and doers who deserve to be found.”

---

## 7. Use Calls to Action (CTAs) Wisely

Every page should give readers a next step:  
- “Get a quote”  
- “Schedule a consultation”  
- “Shop the collection”  
- “See our portfolio”  

CTAs shouldn’t feel pushy — they should feel like the natural conclusion to the story you’ve told.  

If you’re working with a designer or writer, make sure CTAs are clear, visible, and aligned with your goals.

## 8. Edit Without Killing the Personality

A little polish is good; perfection isn’t.  
Great web writing keeps a bit of the writer’s rhythm and voice.  

Avoid over-editing until it sounds robotic.  
Instead, read your content out loud — fix what feels clunky, leave what feels real.

---

## 9. Include Local and Social Proof

Add local touchpoints wherever you can — mention towns, communities, or regional details that matter to your audience.  
Pair that with real **testimonials, case studies, or reviews** to back up your story.  

This blend of local detail and social proof builds both trust and SEO strength.

---

## 10. Keep Updating

Your website shouldn’t stay frozen in time.  
Add new blog posts, project stories, or customer spotlights every few months.  
Search engines love freshness — and so do customers checking to see if you’re still active.
