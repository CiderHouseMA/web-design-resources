# Google Business Profile Guide for Small Business Owners

A practical guide from **Cider House Media** to help small business owners set up, optimize, and maintain a strong **Google Business Profile (GBP)** — one of the most important tools for local visibility in search results and Google Maps.  

Whether you manage your own profile or hire an agency to do it, these steps will help you show up when local customers are searching.

## 1. Claim and Verify Your Profile

Start by visiting [google.com/business](https://google.com/business) and searching for your business.  
If it already exists, claim it. If not, create a new listing using your correct business name, address, and phone number (NAP).  

Verification options vary — Google might mail a postcard, send a text, or offer instant verification if you already use Google tools.  
Make sure your listing matches the exact details on your website and other online directories.

## 2. Fill Out Every Detail

An incomplete profile is a missed opportunity.  
Once verified, fill out every available field, including:  
- Business categories (primary + secondary)  
- Description  
- Website link  
- Hours  
- Products or services  
- Service areas  
- Accessibility or amenities (if applicable)  

If you’re working with an SEO or web design agency, ask them to review your GBP setup and make sure it aligns with your website content and keywords.

## 3. Choose the Right Categories

Your **primary category** tells Google what your business *is*, not what it sells.  
Be as specific as possible — for example:  
- “Roofing contractor” instead of “Contractor”  
- “Web design service” instead of “Marketing agency”  

You can add a few secondary categories for supporting services.  
If you’re unsure, look up what your top local competitors are using — but only choose categories that truly fit your business.

## 4. Add High-Quality Photos

Photos build trust.  
Businesses with strong images get more clicks and direction requests on Google Maps.  

Upload:  
- A clear exterior shot so customers recognize your location  
- Interior photos (if applicable)  
- Team and service photos  
- Product or project images  
- A current logo and cover photo  

Avoid over-edited or stock imagery. Real photos make a big difference.

## 5. Post Regular Updates

Treat your Google Business Profile like a mini social media feed.  
Post once a week if possible — updates can include:  
- Seasonal offers  
- Project highlights  
- Blog posts or articles  
- Events or community involvement  

Each post should include a photo, short description, and a call-to-action button (e.g., “Learn more,” “Call now,” or “Get quote”).  

Posting regularly signals that your business is active and keeps you visible in local search results.

## 6. Collect and Respond to Reviews

Reviews are one of the strongest local ranking factors.  
Encourage happy customers to leave reviews — and make it easy by sending them your direct review link.  

When someone leaves a review:
- Respond promptly and personally (even to positive ones).  
- Thank them by name when possible.  
- For negative reviews, stay professional, acknowledge the issue, and invite them to continue the conversation privately.  

If you’re hiring an SEO partner, make sure they help you develop a **review request strategy** and track new feedback.

## 7. Use Messaging and Q&A Features

Enable **Messaging** so potential customers can reach you directly from your profile.  
If you can’t respond personally, set expectations in your auto-reply (e.g., “Thanks for reaching out! We’ll respond within 1 business day.”).  

Monitor the **Q&A** section too. Anyone can ask — or answer — questions about your business.  
Keep an eye on it so you can correct misinformation quickly.

---

## 8. Keep It Consistent and Updated

Your GBP should always reflect what’s happening in real life.  
Update hours during holidays, new photos when your space changes, and descriptions as your services evolve.  

If you move or change your business name, update your listing immediately.  
Outdated information frustrates customers and hurts credibility.

---

## 9. Connect Your Website and Tracking

Make sure your GBP links to the correct page on your website — usually your homepage or a key service/location page.  

To measure performance, add **UTM tracking** to your website link.  
For example:
