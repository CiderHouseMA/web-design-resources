# Website Accessibility Basics for Small Business Owners

A practical guide from **Cider House Media** to help small business owners understand why accessibility matters — and how to make their websites easier for everyone to use.  

At Cider House, we believe the internet should be accessible to everyone, regardless of any physical or cognitive limitations they might have. Accessibility isn’t just about compliance — it’s about inclusion, clarity, and respect for all visitors.

## 1. What Website Accessibility Really Means

Accessibility means making sure people of all abilities can use and understand your website.  
That includes visitors who:
- Use screen readers or voice navigation  
- Have limited vision or color blindness  
- Navigate primarily with a keyboard  
- Experience hearing, motor, or cognitive challenges  

An accessible website ensures that no one is excluded from reading your content, contacting your business, or buying your products.

## 2. Why Accessibility Matters for SEO and Business

Accessibility isn’t just a legal or ethical issue — it’s also good for SEO.  
Search engines read websites similarly to screen readers: they depend on structure, clear headings, and text-based descriptions.  

A well-structured, accessible site often loads faster, ranks better, and converts more visitors.  
It also protects your business from potential ADA compliance issues — something more companies are being held accountable for each year.

## 3. Use Headings for Structure, Not Decoration

One of the biggest mistakes web designers make is using **headings as a design element** rather than a content outline.  

Headings (H1, H2, H3, etc.) should create a logical hierarchy that explains how your content is organized — just like chapters in a book.  

A proper heading structure looks like this:
- **H1**: Page Title (used once per page)  
- **H2**: Major Sections  
- **H3**: Subtopics within each section  

This helps users — and Google — understand the relationships between topics. It’s the foundation of both accessibility and SEO.

## 4. Use Tools to Check Accessibility

There are great tools that can automatically scan your website for accessibility issues:
- [**Google PageSpeed Insights**](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) — includes an accessibility score alongside performance and SEO metrics.  
- [**WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool**](https://wave.webaim.org/) — quick visual feedback on color contrast and heading order.  
- [**axe DevTools**](https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/) — professional-grade browser extension for accessibility testing.  
- [**Lighthouse**](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) — built into Chrome Developer Tools.  

These tools flag missing alt text, color contrast problems, heading misorder, and more.  
Check your site monthly — or after any major redesign.

## 5. Add an Accessibility Widget or Plugin

Accessibility overlays can make your site easier to navigate for visitors with specific needs.  
For WordPress, there are several reliable plugins that add accessibility controls or automatic enhancements:
- [**AccessiBe**](https://accessibe.com/a/wvjcmfp) – commercial-grade solution with robust keyboard navigation and screen reader support.  
- [**A11y (ALLY)**](https://elementor.com/blog/accessibility-ally-plugin/) – integrates directly with Elementor and other WordPress builders.  
- [**UserWay**](https://userway.org/) – customizable overlay with language and contrast controls.  
- [**WP Accessibility**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-accessibility/) – free plugin that adds skip links, ARIA landmarks, and alt attribute tools.  

While these plugins help, they don’t replace proper design. Think of them as supplements, not substitutes, for accessible code and structure.

## 6. Use Color and Contrast Thoughtfully

Make sure your text has strong contrast against its background — black on white or dark gray on light backgrounds works best.  
Avoid relying on color alone to communicate meaning (for example, don’t make “required fields” red without also adding an asterisk or label).  

Use tools like [**WebAIM’s Contrast Checker**](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to confirm your colors meet WCAG standards.

## 7. Always Add Alt Text to Images

Every image on your site should include **alt text** — a short, accurate description that explains what’s in the picture.  

Good alt text:
- Describes the image briefly (not just keywords)  
- Provides context when images contain text or information  
- Avoids filler like “image of” or “photo of”  

Example:  
> “Owner of Cider House Media meeting with a local business client in Easthampton office.”

This helps screen reader users understand your content and gives search engines more context.

---

## 8. Make Links and Buttons Descriptive

“Click here” or “Read more” doesn’t help anyone using assistive technology.  
Instead, use specific link text that tells users where they’re going:  
> “Learn more about our web design services” or “Download the full SEO checklist.”  

Descriptive buttons and links also improve SEO and usability for everyone.

---

## 9. Test Keyboard Navigation

Anyone should be able to move through your site using only a keyboard — using **Tab**, **Shift + Tab**, and **Enter** to navigate menus and forms.  

If your menus, pop-ups, or buttons trap focus or require a mouse, that’s an accessibility problem.  
Check this manually or ask your developer to test for keyboard-friendly navigation.

---

## 10. Make Accessibility an Ongoing Practice

Accessibility isn’t a one-time checklist.  
Whenever you add a new page, image, or feature, take a moment to confirm that it works for everyone.  

Your web designer or SEO partner should include accessibility in every phase — from wireframes to content creation to site testing.  
At Cider House Media, it’s built into our process because inclusion is part of what makes the web better for all of us.
