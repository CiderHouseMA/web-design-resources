## 4. Use Focus Keywords — But Don’t Obsess Over Them

Every SEO plugin gives you a **Focus Keyword** field and a color-coded score.  
That score is helpful, but it’s not a grade from Google — it’s a *checklist from the plugin developer*.  

Each tool looks for a certain percentage of keyword repetition in headings and text.  
However, it’s possible to rank very well even if your plugin score isn’t perfect.  

> What matters most is **topic coverage**, **clarity**, and **relevance**, not keyword density.

Use your focus keyword in your **H1** (page title) and at least one **H2** if it fits naturally.  
Then write freely about the topic, including related phrases and long-tail variations.  
Don’t force keywords just to turn the score green — that’s how AI-like content gets born.

## 5. Avoid Keyword Cannibalization

Each page on your site should target a **unique keyword theme**.  
If you use the same exact focus keyword on multiple pages, they’ll compete with each other.  

Instead, build a topic cluster:  
- Main service page targets “Web Design in Easthampton, MA.”  
- Blog post supports it with “How to Choose a Local Web Design Company.”  

This helps Google understand which page should rank for which intent — and improves overall visibility.

## 6. Optimize Meta Titles and Descriptions

Your **meta title** is what shows up in Google search results — treat it like a headline.  
Keep it under 60 characters, include your keyword near the beginning, and make it appealing to click.  

Your **meta description** should be around 150–160 characters and summarize what readers will get from the page.  
Example:  
> “Cider House Media builds fast, SEO-friendly WordPress websites for small businesses in Western Massachusetts. Learn how our design process drives local results.”

Every plugin allows you to edit these fields individually for each page or post.

## 7. Set Up Schema Markup

Schema markup helps search engines understand the type of content on your page (article, product, service, local business, etc.).  
Rank Math and AIOSEO include strong schema tools — Yoast handles it automatically for most post types.  

For local businesses, make sure your plugin adds **LocalBusiness schema**, including your name, address, phone number, and operating hours.  
This helps Google display rich results like star ratings and business panels.

## 8. Submit Your XML Sitemap

SEO plugins automatically generate an **XML sitemap**, which lists all your important pages.  
Submit it in **Google Search Console** under *Sitemaps → Add a new sitemap*.  

The typical URL format looks like:
