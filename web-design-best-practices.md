# Web Design Best Practices for Small Business Owners

A practical guide from **Cider House Media**, written to help small business owners understand what makes a website effective — and what to look for if you’re hiring someone to build or redesign yours.  

Good web design isn’t about trends or templates. It’s about clarity, function, and trust. Whether you’re building your own site or working with a design agency, these best practices will help you make confident, informed choices.

## 1. Start with Purpose

Every great website starts with a clear purpose. Before any design work begins, make sure your designer understands your goals — who you serve, what problems you solve, and what actions you want visitors to take.  

A good agency should help you map out a **sitemap** that makes sense for your business, guides users through your key pages, and builds momentum toward conversion (like scheduling a call, requesting a quote, or visiting your shop).  

If you’re writing your own content, ask your designer to provide structure and direction so your copy works for the web — concise, scannable, and customer-focused.

## 2. Design for Mobile First

It’s 2025, and we still see too many websites that fall apart on phones. Most visitors today reach your business from a mobile device, so your site must look and function flawlessly on small screens.  

If you’re working with a web designer, check their recent work on your phone — not just a desktop preview. Buttons should be easy to tap, menus should be simple, and text should never require pinching or zooming.  

Ask your designer if they use **responsive design** (not a separate mobile site) — it’s the modern standard and a must for SEO.

## 3. Prioritize Speed and Performance

No one waits for a slow site — and Google doesn’t, either.  

A good web designer should test your site’s speed before launch. Ask how they handle:
- Image optimization and compression  
- Hosting and caching (especially if using WordPress)  
- Removing unnecessary scripts or plugins  
- Using modern image formats like **WebP**  

If you’re doing it yourself, tools like **GTmetrix** and **PageSpeed Insights** show exactly where improvements are needed.

## 4. Keep Navigation Simple

Here’s a phrase we use often: **a confused mind says no.**  

Your visitors should know what you offer and how to take the next step within seconds. A solid website guides them through three core questions:
1. What do you do?  
2. How can you help me?  
3. How do I get started?  

If your designer suggests overly complex menus or cluttered layouts, push back. Clear pathways always win. Keep navigation under six main items when possible.

## 5. Write for Humans (and the Web)

Even in 2025, people don’t *read* websites — they *scan* them.  

Whether you’re writing your own copy or your designer handles it, the tone should sound human and conversational. Avoid filler and formal phrases. At the same time, a skilled designer or writer will ensure your text naturally fits **search intent** — balancing human tone with smart keyword placement.  

You can “tickle the algorithms,” as we like to say, without sounding robotic.

## 6. Make It Accessible

Accessibility isn’t a luxury; it’s a necessity — both ethically and legally.  

Your designer should ensure the site meets **WCAG accessibility standards**, including color contrast, readable fonts, and proper heading structure.  
For WordPress users, there are plugins like **AccessiBe**, **WP Accessibility**, and **UserWay** that can add overlays or accessibility controls.  

If you’re hiring someone, ask what tools or audits they use to test accessibility. A good answer means they take inclusion seriously.

---

## 7. Build Trust with Visual Consistency

Your brand should feel cohesive from page to page — same fonts, colors, and tone.  
If your site includes multiple design styles or inconsistent visuals, it creates doubt.  

Ask your designer for a **style guide** or brand reference sheet before they begin. This ensures alignment between your logo, website, and marketing materials.

---

## 8. Include Local Context

If your business serves a geographic area, local context should be part of your story.  
Mention your city or region naturally in text and headlines. Include a map, your address, and even photos of your storefront or team.  

If your designer is handling SEO, make sure they’re optimizing your content for local search — it’s what helps you appear in Google’s “near me” results.

---

## 9. Keep Content Fresh

A website isn’t a one-time project. It’s a living part of your business.  
Plan to update it a few times a year with new photos, seasonal offers, or blog posts.  

If you hire an agency, ask how they support **content updates** after launch — do they train you to edit your own pages, or offer ongoing support?  
A strong web partner helps you stay in control of your content long-term.

---

## 10. Measure What Matters

Ask your web designer to install **Google Analytics** and **Search Console** so you can see how people find and interact with your site.  
Request a walkthrough after launch — not just login credentials.  

Tracking what’s working helps you make smarter decisions, improve SEO, and understand your customers better.
