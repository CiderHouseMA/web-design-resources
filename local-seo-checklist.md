# Local SEO Checklist for Small Businesses

A quick, practical overview of the local SEO steps we use at **Cider House Media** when building or auditing websites for small, service-based businesses that depend on local clientele.

These recommendations focus on visibility in **Google Search** and **Google Maps** — the places your nearby customers are already looking.

---

## 1. Local Foundations
- Create or claim your **Google Business Profile (GBP)** and verify ownership.  
- Add consistent **Name, Address, and Phone (NAP)** information across your website, GBP, and social media.  
- Use a local phone number and physical address when possible.  
- Select accurate **business categories** and add detailed service areas in your GBP.  
- Encourage customers to leave **authentic Google reviews** regularly.

---

## 2. On-Page Optimization
- Include your **city and state** in page titles, meta descriptions, and H1 headings (e.g., “Web Design in Easthampton, MA”).  
- Mention nearby towns or service areas naturally within your content.  
- Embed a **Google Map** on your contact page for trust and relevance.  
- Use descriptive **alt text** on photos (e.g., “Easthampton web design studio homepage layout”).  
- Link internally between your service pages, location pages, and blog posts.

---

## 3. Content Strategy
- Write content that reflects **local life and business context** — highlight neighborhoods, community events, or regional details.  
- Add case studies or testimonials from real local clients.  
- Use blog posts to answer common regional questions (e.g., “How to choose a web designer in Western Massachusetts”).  
- Include at least one **outbound link** to a credible local organization, chamber of commerce, or nonprofit.

---

## 4. Technical & Performance
- Ensure your site loads in under **3 seconds** and passes **mobile usability** tests.  
- Use **HTTPS**, fix broken links, and update plugins regularly.  
- Create and submit your **XML Sitemap** and **robots.txt** to Google Search Console.  
- Implement **schema markup** for your business (LocalBusiness, Organization, or Service schema).  
- Compress and name images with local context (e.g., `northampton-web-design-team.jpg`).

---

## 5. Ongoing Local SEO

- Post regularly to your **Google Business Profile** — updates, new photos, project highlights, and seasonal offers.  
- Build **local backlinks** through real relationships:  
  - Partner with complementary businesses (for example, a plumber linking to a local electrician, roofer, or contractor).  
  - Exchange “Recommended Local Partner” links in a short paragraph on each other’s websites.  
  - Sponsor youth sports teams, charity events, or community organizations — these often include sponsor links on local .org or .gov sites.  
  - Contribute to **local news outlets or blogs** when you complete noteworthy projects.  
- Add your business to **reputable local directories** (chamber of commerce, tourism boards, local business associations, and niche directories related to your trade).  
- Check and update your **NAP listings** quarterly for consistency.  
- Monitor **keyword rankings** and traffic for your “service + city” combinations.  
- Keep collecting **reviews** — respond to every one, including the positive ones, to show engagement.  
- Periodically audit your backlinks to make sure they remain relevant and local.
