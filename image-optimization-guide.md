Search engines read filenames, so clear names help your images appear in Google Image Search and improve on-page relevance.

## 7. Add Alt Text for Every Image

Alt text helps screen readers describe images to visually impaired users — and gives search engines context.  

A good rule:
- Describe what’s shown, not what the file is called.  
- Keep it short and natural.  

Example:  
> “Craftsman sanding a handmade wooden bowl at Spencer Peterman workshop.”

Avoid keyword stuffing — accuracy is what matters.

## 8. Responsible Image Sourcing

Never pull images straight from Google Images — most are copyrighted.  
Use stock photo sites that clearly license their content for commercial use.

**Free stock resources:**
- [**Unsplash**](https://unsplash.com/)  
- [**Pexels**](https://pexels.com/)  
- [**Pixabay**](https://pixabay.com/)  

**Paid options:**
- [**Adobe Stock**](https://stock.adobe.com/)  
- [**Shutterstock**](https://www.shutterstock.com/)  
- [**iStock**](https://www.istockphoto.com/)  

When possible, use your own photos — authentic imagery always performs better.

## 9. Automate Where It Makes Sense

If you upload lots of images, consider WordPress automation tools:
- **Smush** – compresses and lazy-loads images automatically.  
- **Imagify** – includes bulk optimization and WebP conversion.  
- **ShortPixel** – strong compression with backups of originals.  

These help, but always start with good source files before upload.

## 10. Review Performance

Run your site through [**Google PageSpeed Insights**](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) and [**GTmetrix**](https://gtmetrix.com/) after adding new images.  
Both tools analyze how quickly your pages load and flag any oversized or uncompressed files.  

**PageSpeed Insights** offers detailed Core Web Vitals data and an **“Opportunities”** section showing where you can save loading time.  
**GTmetrix** provides a more visual breakdown — including waterfall charts, request details, and historical tracking if you create a free account.  

Reviewing both gives you a complete picture of how your images (and site) perform over time.

### Key Takeaway

Image optimization isn’t complicated — it’s a habit.  
Start with clean, properly sized files, compress before uploading, and use meaningful names and alt text.  
Your visitors (and search rankings) will thank you.
